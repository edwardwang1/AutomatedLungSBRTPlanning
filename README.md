# Dose Prediction
The files in this repository are used to train models to predict 3-D dose distributions in lung SABR. The preprocessing steps are similar to the ones described in [this repo](https://github.com/edwardwang1/LungSBRT_GAN)

# Dose Mimicking
We use matlab for the dose mimicking operation. The code is currently contained in a [fork](https://github.com/edwardwang1/matRad/tree/dev_VMAT_merge) of the original matRad code, however future plans are to migrate the relevant code into this repository.
